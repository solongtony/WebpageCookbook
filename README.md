# Webpage Cookbook

My personal web page recipes; small demonstrations of fundamental HTML, JavaScript, and DOM concepts. Each recipe is a small complete page of hand written HTML and JavaScript. Each one demonstrates a single task or concept. These are not templates or examples for production webpages.

I chose the name Cookbook after the line of tech books including *The Java Cookbook*, which was my favorite Java book.

I wrote most of these when I was learning HTML several years ago.  Unfortunatly they were only written for IE.  Most of them also work in Chrome and Firefox, but not all.
